# AstroColony
Git repository dedicated to the Astro Colony game (script, tools and mods).

This documentation is currently being written and will be updated soon.

In this repository, I'm going to add my various developments for Astro Colony.  
This could be anything from a script to install the dedicated Windows/Lunix server to the little modes I might make.
